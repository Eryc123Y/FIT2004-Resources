    "# Why the naive multiplication algorithm is not efficient for large numbers?\n",
    "The naive multiplication is taking a digit-by-digit approach, which results in a time complexity of O(n×m), where n and m are the number of digits in the two numbers being multiplied. This means that in the worst case, the time taken to multiply two numbers grows O(n^2) with the number of digits in the input numbers. For large numbers, this approach becomes inefficient compared to more advanced algorithms like Karatsuba's algorithm, which have better time complexity for large integer multiplication.\n",

In the naive multiplication algorithm, we need to execute $4 \\times 4$ multiplications and some additions. While using Karatsuba's algorithm, we can break down 1234 to 12|34 and 4321 to 43|21. Then we can calculate the following three multiplications: 12 x 43, 34 x 21, and (12+34) x (43+21). This does not lose any information and reduces the number of multiplications to three, as the final result is represented as a combination of these three multiplications, which is $$12 \\times 43 \\times 10^4 + (12+34) \\times (43+21) \\times 10^2 + 34 \\times 21 \\times 10^0.$$\n",

    "## Correctness of Karatsuba's algorithm\n",
    "Karatsuba's algorithm is based on the principle of polynomial multiplication. It is correct because it leverages the distributive property of multiplication over addition and the fact that the product of two n-digit numbers can be expressed as a combination of three multiplications of n/2-digit numbers, and the completeness of natural numbers (that every number can be recursively defined as a successor of the base case 0). These natures allows us to play with the base of the number system to create a more efficient mapping for the multiplication operation.\n",
