Then we can calculate the following three multiplications: 12 x 43, 34 x 21, and (12+34) x (43+21). This does not lose any information and reduces the number of multiplications to three, as the final result is represented as a combination of these three multiplications, which is $$12 \\times 43 \\times 10^4 + (12+34) \\times (43+21) \\times 10^2 + 34 \\times 21 \\times 10^0.$$\n",

These natures allows us to play with the base of the number system to create a more efficient mapping for the multiplication operation.\n",

    "We can also enumerate the first few levels of the recursion tree and look for a pattern to derive a closed-form solution. It is implied that we have a base case $T(1) = O(1)$, which can be used to solve for the unknown constants in the recurrence relation.\n",

    "While we can use a little trick here to facilitate the proof of worst case complexity, we can derive directly that $ T(n) = 3T(n/2) + c \\cdot n$, this is because, we donot always have the same digit number in the two numbers, so we can replace equality with less than or equal to.\n",

    "Note that, the base case is $T(1) = O(1)$, which implies that $n/2^i = 1$, so $i = \\log_2(n)$, and we can substitute this to the expression above\n",

    "The constant part of the expression does not depend on $n$, so when $n \\to \\infty$, the time complexity is dominated by the term $3^{\\log_2(n)} = n^{\\log_2(3)}$, which is the approximately $n^{1.585}$.\n",

    "### Mathematical Induction\n",
    "This method is similar to the substitution method, but it uses mathematical induction to prove the correctness of the derived solution. We can prove the correctness of the solution by induction on the number of levels in the recursion tree. However, this method is less common in practice for analyzing the time complexity of algorithms, because you need to have the mathematical insight to derive the closed-form solution, and then prove it using induction. So in most case, we are asked to use MI in excercise or exam, but in real world, we use the other methods.\n",
