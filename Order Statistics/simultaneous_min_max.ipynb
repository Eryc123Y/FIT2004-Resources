    "# Simultaneous Minimum and Maximum\n",
    "Simultaneous Minimum and Maximum is an algorithm to find the minimum and maximum element in an array with fewer comparisons than the naive approach of finding the minimum and maximum separately. The algorithm is based on the idea that we can find the minimum and maximum in a single pass through the array."
